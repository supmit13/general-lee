Website hits generator bot with configurable proxy list and human net surfer emulator - It emulates human behaviour during generating HTTP requests to the targetted websites by entering random time intervals between 2 consecutive requests, and also sends a valid 'Referer' header and 'User-Agent' header so that the web-server doesn't suspect it to be a bot.
